```Capacity``` actually represents the number of elements an array could take if it was filled up.
Ironically it is gotten using the ```length``` method an an array. e.g ```arr.length```

```length``` represents the numbers of positions that have been occupied in an array.
This can be gotten by looping through the array and checking if the element is null or not (this is for objects)
for ```int```s checking if it is 0 or not

**Note**: this applies to java
